Here are the most useful commands to use in work:
1 - touch = create a new file

2 - cd .. ; cd ../.. = to move between files

3 - vim <file.txt> = open and edit files (ESC, :q,:w, :a ...)

4 - Git add <file> = start to track the file

5 - Git commit -m '<message>' = send a commit for the tracked files (the commit is just in your divice)

6 - Git push -u <branch> = Push the commit for the specific branch and change to this branch

7 - Git pull = get updated all the new changes

8 - Git branch <branch> = just create a new branch 

9 - Git checkout -b <BranchName> = create a new branch and change to this created branch

10 - Git init = initialize a new local repository created (mkdir then Git init) - is only available in your machine repository

11 - Git Clone <link> = Copy the repository

12 Git HEAD

13 - Git Diff = look the differences between files, branches...

14 - Git Blame = look who, when, and what is the changes in detais

(Obs: The main difference between create a new branch and fork is that with the fork you just create a copy of the repository and cannot merge after the changes. You just copy to use)
