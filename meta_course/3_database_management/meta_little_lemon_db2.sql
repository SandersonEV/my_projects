-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ WORKING WITH SUBQUERIES ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Sometimes is better to start thinking in the subquery first and after add to de outer query (START SMALL so you can pass trought)

-- Task 1: Write a SQL SELECT query to find all bookings that are due after the booking of the guest ‘Vanessa McCarthy’.

SELECT BookingID, CONCAT(GuestFirstName, ' ', GuestLastName) 'Nome Completo',BookingSlot 'Hora da Reserva' FROM bookings WHERE BookingSlot > (
SELECT BookingSlot FROM bookings WHERE GuestFirstName = 'Vanessa' AND GuestLastName = 'McCarthy'
)
;

-- Task 2: Write a SQL SELECT query to find the menu items that are more expensive than all the 'Starters' and 'Desserts' menu item types.

SELECT * FROM menuitems WHERE Price > (
SELECT MAX(Price) FROM menuitems WHERE Type IN ('Starters','Desserts')
)
;

-- Task 3: Write a SQL SELECT query to find the menu items that costs the same as the starter menu items that are Italian cuisine.

SELECT * FROM menuitems WHERE Price = (
   SELECT Price FROM menuitems WHERE ItemID IN (
       SELECT ItemID FROM menus WHERE Cuisine = 'Italian'
       ) 
	AND Type = 'Starters'
)
;

-- Task 4: Write a SQL SELECT query to find the menu items that were not ordered by the guests who placed bookings.

SELECT * FROM menuitems WHERE ItemID NOT IN (
	SELECT ItemID FROM menus WHERE MenuID IN (
		SELECT MenuID FROM tableorders WHERE BookingID IN (
			SELECT BookingID FROM bookings
            )
		)

Task 1: Find the minimum and the maximum average prices at which the customers can purchase food and drinks.

Task 2: Insert data of menu items with a minimum price based on the 'Type' into the LowCostMenuItems table.
Hint: In this task, you must write subqueries in INSERT statements. Your subquery would find the details of menu items with a minimum price based on the 'Type' of menu item. 
In other words, GROUP BY Type. Then you can insert the data retrieved from the subquery into the LowCostMenuItems table using an INSERT INTO SELECT statement.

Task 3: Delete all the low-cost menu items whose price is more than the minimum price of menu items that have a price between $5 and $10.
Hint: You need to write subqueries in DELETE statements in this task. Your subquery will be placed in the WHERE clause of the DELETE statement to find the minimum prices of menu items that have a price between $5 and $10.
 Use the ALL operator in the outer query to find matches from the values returned from the subquery. Delete those records with matching prices from the LowCostMenuItems table.
